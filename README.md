*I kept my wireframe very basic so that who ever is viewing this can focus on the structure of the website instead of the look.
*On the top left of the website it will have the name and logo.
*The boxes you see on the top right is the menu and they follow you throughout the entire website. The Home button, which when pressed and you're on another part of the website will take you back to the home page.
*The Store button will take you to a page where you can view all the products.
*The About button will take you to a page that will have what our views are.
*The last one is the Cart button that will take you to your shopping cart.
*Bellow that is a big button that will display our new collection. It will rotate through the new products in intervals of 4 seconds. 
*Bellow that on the left is the Shop All that does the same as the Shop menu button.
*As well as, the About Us that does the exact same as the About menu button.
*Bellow all that is the Contact Us. This will allow the customer to leave a review or just contact us for any assistance.
